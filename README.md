# Traffic_Sign_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning
In this project, we will be able to:

- Understand the theory and intuition behind Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Import Key libraries, dataset and visualize images.
- Perform image normalization and convert from color-scaled to gray-scaled images.
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.
- Compile and fit Deep Learning model to training data. 
- Assess the performance of trained CNN and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
- Improve network performance using regularization techniques such as dropout.
